SAVR_ROM_Crespo
===============

A custom ROM is one that has undergone any modification from being a pure distribution of Android. Google make the Android source code available for anyone to play around with, and people take this code and alter it for themselves. Whether to add features they come up with, or to redistribute it with fun tweaks and additions. So a custom ROM can range in definition from some custom code modifications to make Android run better on a device, all the way to changing the homescreen, background services, and default software.

This is a Custom ROM developed for NEXUS S (CRESPO) devices. It is a deodexed, pre-rooted and de-bloated ROM with various tweaks for battery performance, network usuage, CPU performance and many more applied to have a true speedy experience.

Builds from these repository are currently uploaded on FireDrive and used by XDA members.
